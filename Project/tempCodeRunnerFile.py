Let's start by thinking about circular motion (well, really it's polygon motion
# that is close to circular motion). Assume that Traxbot lives on 
# an (x, y) coordinate plane and (for now) is sending you PERFECTLY ACCURATE sensor 
# measurements. 
#
# With a few measurements you should be able to figure out the step size and the 
# turning angle that Traxbot is moving with.
# With these two pieces of information, you should be able to 
# write a function that can predict Traxbot's next location.
